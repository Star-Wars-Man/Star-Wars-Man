    Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she
    looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.<br>
    <br>
    “My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and
    covering her face with kisses. “Where in the world did you come from?”<br>

    And oh, Aunt Em! I'm so glad to be at home again!”<br><br>
